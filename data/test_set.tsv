BE CAUTIOUS YELP USERS!!!	I loved that all of their vehicles come without accessories and you add what you want/need; not the things they think everyone should have.	Overall, great experience.	for everything !	Being that I USED to take my car here for service, I decided that I'd call and see if they had any advice.	Initial interactions were positive - they were flexible and easy going.	Six days later, I call again, still doesn't answer, I leave another message.	You'll sleep better at night.	They close up for what I think was a couple weeks at the end of the year.	When browsing for my second car,  Jeff  talked me out of buying a more expensive Volkswagen and recommended a cheaper Honda - they are not in it for the money.	i had bought the car a week ago, and it ran perfectly fine.	Jeff told us he would buy the part and fix it at no charge to us!	Then on Sunday 10/02/16, I was going through online ads and there it was, my dream car!	Had a coolant leak and made the mistake of bringing my truck to Autonation Dodge Service center.	And why don't you have basic Toyota ceramic brakes in?	You might want to think twice about getting a "deal" at Championship.	Max is an independent car dealer and is passionate about the cars that he sells.	Take your business elsewhere!	He gave me a very fair price.	Would absolutely recommend to friends and family.	An easy 1-2 hours shop rate just written off and advice/guidance given instead.	I had a positive experience for being a single female buying a car.	I'll be back and will send all family.	Of course there are risks involved with buying any used car and it is my fault for trusting such a character.	Got a good car at a reasonable price with a minimum of hassle or aggressive sales techniques.	These guys made it easy!	I have had my Mini for 5 years and have now spent more than $9,000 on unscheduled repairs (things going wrong that are not supposed to).	I got to drive the car and they told me everything I needed to know with the car.	Car has been great since.	For liability reasons the tire shop would not let me keep the two front tires.	This was THE BEST experience that I have had purchasing a vehicle.	He said "I already gave you a good deal on the truck, I will not pay for even half the bill (which is going to be $175.00) unless your willing to buy another car from me.	Definitely would recommend Finesse Auto Sales.	Typical used car dealer and will lie and hide the truth if they can and they can get away with it because of online and phone conversation transaction.	With condescending tone, he immediately says, "I am the Used Car Director, I am not spending any more money on your car!"	There was no need for attitude.	Can't stand that stuff.	Moe's Automotive is fantastic.	Well we took our complaints to the BBB (the complaint is on the website) and Drive Auto basically refused to admit to anything.	Carlos helped us out and was AWESOME!	I found them online after I spotted a great deal on a 2005 Kia Spectra.	My overall impression is that the transaction went no differently than it would have had I purchased the car from a private party on craigslist.	If you want to purchase a mechanically sound used vehicle, I recommend these guys.	This is the kind of business that will keep me coming back.	Glad I went with my gut on this one.	They picked car for me based on my requirement and in no time I was able to drive the car out of the door.	Jeff replaces it and everything is good.	When we got there, the car was in the lot, and was exactly as advertised.	We don't really even consider ourselves car buyers.	I brought it up with Ed & Blake and they immediately took responsibility and told me they would fix it and that they promised it would be washed outside & inside the second time.	A 2011 Toyota camry with less than 15k miles.	I sat in several of the cars before choosing one to drive and take home.	Purchased a car from them in July 2016, the car is very clean and in good shape.	Safety conscious, socialistic nanny states oddly have three times the brands and models we do.	No debit or credit cards possible.	The dealership is stacked with a wide range of affordable vehicles and their inventory changes regularly, as they move cars out and bring new cars in.	I'd highly recommend if looking for a good deal, with a personal touch and great customer service.	The dealership worked with an auto body shop who did changed the coating and the finish product was satisfactory.	Quick negotiation, got to the bank in time to get the check and in-out in an hour or so.	This is the second time I bought a car from these guys!	Everything Toyota of Seattle advertises as benefits of buying through them is ABSOLUTELY the truth.	I had to call the bank and find out information on my own.	Already fix my auxiliary issue by re soldering it.	They were fast, did super quality work, and so friendly.	I was extremely impressed with their professionalism and their kindness.	I couldn't believe the customer service and the strings they pulled to make this possible.	Somewhere along the way, "several" Cobalts became just this one.	It was very refreshing, no nonsense, just facts.	I will be coming back for my next vehicle.	Carter itself seems like a really good, respectable dealer.	If only I'd known buying a newer car could be this relaxing and satisfying.	Every person was just great, and it makes me inclined to get another Subaru just to experience that service again.	I'd like to give a personal thanks to Shawn, who helped me with the issue and getting everything resolved immediately.	We then took our car Park Place Limited, who looked it over and found the battery tested fine and the pump wasn't bad after all-Audi Bellevue had lied, completely.	Like the review before me, I think they deserve negative stars!	While this can be a good idea to purchase, it wasn't in my case.	The car was nicely maintained, can be described as almost new.	Charges were almost half of the estimate.	She also talked with us about dealer versus bank/credit union financing options.	Discovery of the rust was just one of those things, and was a surprise to everyone.	We just bought a Lexus CT F-Sport yesterday from this amazing place with excellent salesmen.	Barry even followed up a week later to see how we liked the car.	And then we were told they weren't willing to pay for the cost because we had driven too many miles on it!	I have bought here my last SUbaru Forester and am very happy with it, except for AC doesn't work still, although they refilled it on the spot while we've waited.	One week later, I get a call from the sales manager.	I was very pleased with the experience, and I would rank it as one of the best car shopping experience I have ever had.	I called ahead of time and talked to Tyler about a 2007 Escalade they had on the lot and he gave me the complete history and what kind of condition it was in.	The staff was very courteous and helpful, in fact, they even found me a better rate on my loan, and called me back the day after I purchased the vehicle to update the documents and lock in my lower interest rate.	So we came to the decision that we should sell it (yikes!!).	A great experience in which I was able to get the net price I had hoped for which was $2,000 more than the Audi dealer was willing to pay.	However, he and his partners proved themselves to be unethical in their business dealings.	To boot, Toyota had only built 1000 in Inferno Red and were doling them out piece by piece.	In his lot, i felt i am talking to a friend not a sales person trying to get my money..	Ezra was so helpful with the entire process, he was able to take me on a test drive of the car, and explain to me everything I needed to know about the make and model.	These guys have earned a customer for life.	And thanks again David Bruski for reminding me that there are some great individuals who are in the sales profession.	These guys are as good as it gets and they are all local.	Their expertise was legit.	And I seen a comment from a lady states that he tries to get you to give them five star rating upon purchasing a vehicle, so don't listen to the five-star ratings online.	They do it right.	I worked with David Khazi and Ryan Vanderwel.	Professional, curteous and such a pleasure to work with.	Car maintenance is fine here, but don't ever purchase a car from this dealership.	Even though it was close to closing, she let us take the car out for a test drive.	I ignored him and began talking about the features that I like including the LATCH system, which he had to ask what that was, and how the safety ratings for the 2014 were fairly high considering how compact the car was.	They are honest people and I will buy another car from them again

Highly recommend.	I'm glad we went to Auto Quest.	She got me an amazing price on a new car and an even more amazing value on my trade.	They have all kinds of connections on where and how to get the best parts or what kind of tires and wheels to get.	Had a great experience here buying my car.	Today is day 8, guess what, no refund.	Justin and the owner Dan let me take the car home for the night!	I've waited over an hour to get called back before calling again myself to find that the representative I was looking for is suddenly available.	Yes, they were a few dollars more, but they provided a great website experience, good communication via email, and safe, reasonably fast coast to coast shipping.	I walked away thrilled with my new Subaru CrossTrek.	It speaks a lot to the integrity and the reliability of a business and its staff when they're standing up to assist you whether you're going to buy a car from them or not.	I would highly recommend you consider them for your next car purchase.	Traded in my 2013 CRV for a 2017 HRV today and had an amazing experience as always!	Zac was very friendly, we went here last week to test drive the car & he pulled up the Lexus right away for us to check it out.	We never had to leave the comfort of our own home to do the whole sale transaction.	I should have just walked out at that point.	Considering how low of miles my vehicle had, the tires were out of alignment, and also need to be replaced, the aux/usb is broken, the brake is squeaky and definitely needs to be looked at, there is creaking in one of the passenger doors, there was a bunch of brown spilled stuff under the back seat by the spare tire, and the audio system and interface is glitchy.	He is great and highly recommended.	I feel like they mask their business with the intent to help people with bad credits but in the end, it's still a game of dollars in their pockets.	Lesson learned, the hard way.	Honesty is something that is almost impossible to come by in the search for a used car but Matt is a full disclosure kind of guy and that is why I know that he'll get me the right car soon.	If you knew the facts you should have just let me walk.	And after I got the car there, I had it by that afternoon.	Been in the market for around 2 month looking for a BMW convertible and i know the price range of BMW 428 convertible in the market.	And 3 months later, I'm having a little peace with my purchase but still feel like their customer service is more like a 2 out of 5 but overall I would say it is a 3/5, but I put 2/5 because truly, their customer service can be super rude, then next day they're super friendly.	Thay have the hotlist cats in Seattle down town Seattle I've been by thare a million times slobbering on my self as I look and when o go in and look and I all to some one I'll post more

This was my first car purchase at other than at dealership.	I highly recommend David North and Ally if you are in the market of buying Subaru.	Robert and Peter provide the best car buying experience one could ask for.	His professionalism and awesome personality made it a relational exchange, rather than simply a transactional one.	Call or email Heidi - she WILL take care of you!	Thanks again Bill!!	In fact, we will try them again for another Car soon.	Thanks to both of you

The level of customer service and genuine thoughtfulness CANNOT be beat.	Tony seems like an honest straight shooter and ive had no problems with my bmw 525i

Words can't express!!	Took it in to Community Automotive and they fixed it.	Go see these guys, especially Chris!!!!!!	So our result was no care for customers , not able to be trusted on their word, self entitled asinine jerks, lack of professionalism, service you expect when dealing with door to door salesman, and clearly no RESPECT for a human being.	Thank you EBA and Dan Lee, as well as Matthew Beagley, the Product Specialist who helped me set up my phone and went over all the features my vehicle has to offer.	Hats off to Superior!	We love Car Club!	I had to buy a car after a bad auto accident and I was exhausted, mad and it wasn't going very well.	She didn't waste any time to get the paper work and trade in appraisal going.	We are past due on getting this review in - we bought the truck in May but here we are - better late than never!	The owner of the mechanic shop was more pissed then I was.	A half hour after arrival, problem fixed and bill more than fair.	I just bought a used car from them.	We bought a BMW Z4 the next day and we can't be happier with our purchase and decision.	The service department is one of the worst.	Definitely 5 stars.	Soon two other people arrive and start checking people in.	I will be back when I'm ready to purchase for my son.	Even the application for credit literally took 10 minutes.	I appreciated the quick and seamless transition.	I recommend this place!	I'll let you know tomorrow (Monday the 23rd) No call Monday.	And rather than do nothing (which was completely in their right to do, as I bought the car "as is"), they agreed to cover half the cost of the restoration.	I would recommend this dealer to anyone!!	I will for sure be a return customer when I start looking for a new car in January!	My salesman was Gianni.	Heidi does not work on commission and charges a very reasonable flat rate for her services.	If you are interested in a LEAF, they have a large stock here to choose from.	I would NOT recommend buying a vehicle from Auto Quest!	As a young female with no car knowledge I always hate going to get my car fixed.	Sometimes I would cruise by when something funny was going on with my car-he would usually pop out and make an adjustment for me right then and there or tell me (A) its major we need to handle it or (B) its minor, no worries, schedule it soon.

Dear Tom,

When we talked recently I did not tell you that part of my career I was a Customer Service Manager for a major retail store and I remember often taking action in support of our customer in the way you did today for us.	I was traveling through town and found these guys on yelp.	He's fair, honest and fast.	No pressure sales, dealer was very knowledgeable and patient.	Even better I know I can trust their mechanics when maintenance and work to need to get done.	Milan earned my car repair trust many times over.	They do not take anything apart, or look into it any further, and only told me it was broken.	We got an amazing car for a great price!	Discount brake was able to unfreeze the stuck piston and sent me on my way with brand new front brake pads.	No charge

I've recently bought my 3rd car from here, and each time it has been a pleasant experience.	When I bought the car from john I asked him specifically was a scar in good condition based off the price because he WAY over charge me and he assured me that the vehicle was in great running condition.	That's why I'm confident to tell you that if you're in search of a new car or see one from his lot that you might want, don't hesitate to at least go check it out.	Great experience, Noel was very knowledgeable and helped us get a great deal on our two trade-ins and the new car.	Nobody greeted us, I attributed this to the fact that it was near closing, so we figured we'd just take a quick look and come back another day.	Huge waste of money.	Thanks again Tyler for treating me so well from the first phone call to the last signature!	The transaction was smooth as can be and what impressed me the most was that after he sold it to me, he continued to take care of me and helped me as much as he could through the phone with any questions I had regarding licensing, paperwork, or any concerns I had with the car.	There is no room for improvement when it comes to working with Tyler, Bill and Todd11
Thank you so much!!	I connected with Kyle Gaylor who was extremely professional and very helpful.	At the time of the deal, when presented with the inspection notes, they consulted w/their affiliated shop, quoting me significant discounts over my mechanic's parts and labor, so I agreed to a price taking that into consideration.	I shouldn't have signed it but I had to otherwise he would refuse to put a new clutch in.	Compare this to the usual "3 guys around back with a bottle of windex" that you'll find at regular dealerships.	I found a car i liked, had no idea where Burien was so i emailed requesting more info on the car.	Because I refused to buy what will wanted me to buy I was declined or pay very high down payment.	No offer to make it right by the "dealer" and I am now stuck with a car that is inoperable- Do not listen to them when they tell you that EVERY car has been inspected and that they have ensured the vehicle is in tip top shape.	I,ve purchased 3 vehicles from Jeff over the last 10 years.	Incredibly unprofessional.	They know me AND my car.	He was very polite and knowledgeable.	So after talking to Matt and re-thinking this over my advise when buying from them is to ASK QUESTIONS.	Finally, they recommend that I get my wheel bearing repacked.	We 've been in US for over 30 years and the credits could be up to the best and times down or bad.	However it's really annoying to be told conflicting stories.	For me to drive all the way from Renton to this car lot you know you know it has to be something special!	When they saw me coming with my double stroller THREE people jumped up to grab the door for me- and that's a win in my book!	Meaning on top of the frame damage they are making me deal with I have a whole lot of front end repairs and replacements coming out of my pocket that I can't afford with my baby on the way.	I have never had such a pleasant experience buying a car as I did here.	He was a little stand off ish about me coming in with a loan from USAA after we had determined that I could get a better rate there.	I was told to come back the next day to find out what happened.	They knocked off 0.6% from an allegedly negotiable fee (and they had the audacity to remove it from the car price instead of the fee itself!).	Note to yourself - bring proof of insurance to test drive a car.	I was free to take the vehicle of interest to my mechanic for an PPI.	I would definitely go to James and his team again for my next purchase and would highly recommend to anyone who is in the market looking for a used car with hassle free experience.	"What happens to the other $110-$120?	I believe this is standard practice for most used-car dealerships, however I think the smaller size of Magnolia Motors (with smaller overhead) allows him to sell at lower prices.	Our car buying experience with Zac was great.	Once we got to the paperwork signing he continued to be patient and explained everything to me in a way that made me feel confident in his knowledge of the vehicle as well as the entire buying/paperwork process.	They are still a car dealer of course so they play their games with pricing, extended warranties and such.	I needed certain options, and didn't want to pay for a lot of options I didn't need They were more than happy to order me a new car if they didn't have a good match in stock - which Toyota didn't want to do - but Carter found a good match in Eastern WA and had it brought over, and will be installing two added options that I need.	I stopped at Carsmart based on the two previous yelp reviews.	I got an easy and honest deal.	Was a great experience to buy a car here.	If you want to buy a no hassle, dmv free, car lot free, stress free car, Buyer's Advantage is for you.	And no doubt I'll be back!!!	IF I hear back from them that is.. .	Here's the quality customer service I got: 

***
Matthew,

Nice yelp review.....	From the onset it was quite apparent that Fin was honest and his passion for treating his customers right and doing right by them was a priority.	David followed up with me everything couple months or so and finally a car that matched my description came in.	I am so happy that I visited.	Emerald City Auto was a unexpected surprise.	Even though it's more out of the way to go to Seattle Mini, I feel confident!	I called in to line up a view/test drive with Albert- he had two hours notice to get the car ready but it wasn't even on the lot when I got there.	It smelled super funky.	My last visit here was very disappointing.	She made the entire experience so uncomfortable that we both left feeling terrible.	I appreciate that because its was a rental car I can be sure that the maintenance was logged and up to date.	I've bought a 2014 STI for me, 2015 forester for my mom, and most recently, 2009 used forester.	And the overall service experience was un-pleasant.	Thanks Dan, I'll be back, and so will my friends.	The only thing was that after we got home we noticed a chip in the window which had been hidden by the rain.	If you come down to this location, you should definitely ask for Kyle and he'll take care of you.	I'll make sure to TELL EVERYONE I know in the military community to stay far from Carter Subaru Shoreline.	This is our 1st vehicle together as husband & wife.	Also of note is that Marcee originally told me that there was "no way I would be able to get a Small SUV in my price range (15-18K), however as soon as I told her I was looking into purchasing a car separate from her service, and she would therefore loose half of her fee, she miraculously had the a "Small SUV" in my price range.	They had an Audi Q5 S-line that was priced very competitively and it had the bigger motor and one of the colors we were looking for.	But He said he is from Canada) not only was he not listening to what we were wanting but tried to sell us his personal diesel truck!	The only positive we can take from this is our sales person was amazing.	Shopping for a car just got easier, no haggle and the greatest customer service.	After that, the keys were left in my new car without anyone there to see me off, shake my hand, or make me feel good about the large check I'd just written.	It was a bit of an emotional purchase for me as well, so I was a bit freaked out.	I drove 6+ other SUVs before deciding on the Forester.	Step one, they gave me a free oil change and I have to go back in 1200 miles to check the oil levels.	All of the salespeople, from what I can tell, truly love cars... And it shows.	They have a no haggle rule and that was music to our ears.	No, really: Toni was fantastic.	I just thought I'd "yelp" a good company when it's deserving!	I check the turn signals.	Seriously - ever rock chips were taken care of.	After her accident last year she wanted no more small cars!	I felt like they did everything they possibly could to help me with financing and making sure the car was in top shape, both in performance and appearance.	Brian, knows his cars, expects his cars to be perfect or they aren't going to be bought or sold by him.	And they also have a carfax for every car they sell.	When I looked at the invoice, all of the above was true, but there was also another page that described $950 more work.	James inspected the car throughout to make sure the car is being fair evaluated and quote.	Not only did he go above and beyond, he even took the time to text me and check in with me twice in the days after I bought the car.	Car was missing paint, transmission doesnt shift into certain gear and very hard to get into gears, suspension is shot, paint isnt the original color of the car all important things they lied about on this classic car I purchased.	Being younger, pulled up in a Subaru, wearing a mechanics shirt, I figured I would be treated as if I could not afford a Maserati or I was there to drive nice cars.	It was a year older and had 7,000 more miles, but I thought that was an amazing price.	My husband and I have avoided dealerships like the plague because they treat customers like dropping $20k is no big deal.	It was amazing and they have great inventory.	Fin made this used car buying experience easy and enjoyable.	We were looking for a very specific SUV (and relatively rare).	I had pleasure doing business with those guys!!!	Our poor old car died and the repairs were more than the cost of the car, so, after MANY years, we were put in the position of buying a car.	He listened to my complaints and was very patient.	Everyone was great and got it for awesome price.	The staff were very responsive, personable, and helpful.	They said the car was in great shape, had no problems, etc.	When the follow-up call came from Toyota of Seattle, I told her how disappointed I was.	I say, "But see here, where it says there was a number of repairs done on 7/8?"	Great first impression.	The car seemed to be in great shape for a 20 year old car and it was what i wanted.	I've bought two vehicles from Toyota of Kirkland in the past, and I had no issues with them at all.	It was a pleasure working with him.	Although there is no haggling and they up charge a bit for profit, but I feel like it was worth it for the customer service.	I still have not decided what to get (well, it's only yesterday), but this experience has certainly raised the bar for what I expect now from a car dealer.	We shouldn't worry the car had a warranty.	I visited the dealership often and got to know the staff and the inventory.	I'm not in the immediate area so it isn't convenient to stop by.	I will never recommend anyone to this place.	Edit: I understand having an outdated Craigslist ad posted but keeping a vehicle listed on Craigslist and reposting it as a NEW ad- then when a customer calls to inquire about that vehicle and saying that the car is not available but "hey we have this other, similar car you might be interested in" is certainly dishonest.	The men were true gentlemen and offered to help as well as give me water and a place to hang out while waiting for the tow truck.	& if you're smart not only should you really take the 1 & 2 star reviews into consideration but please take a look at the owners response.	Any little issues with the car they were willing to fix and they let us take the car with a signed inspection clause so we could take it to our own ford certified mechanic (which we did and they didn't find any problems).	They both help me get the car that I wanted and on top of that they gave me the priced that I was looking forward for my Bmw that I traded in to help me drive home that new new 2016 Mustang ford Gt that same day!!!	Jeff didn't really have a plan for a good test drive route.	One of the best customer service experiences I've ever had!	Great experience.	They did not give me a list or a walk-through of the damage, yet they had me sign a document agreeing to buy the car "as is."	I look forward to working with them again!	They let me stop by to dispose of the old battery that I hadn't even purchased from them, AND they tightened the fastening on our battery free of charge.	She was quick and didn't waste any time, we took a certified STI out for a test drive and she was knowledgeable, friendly, casual, and not pushy.	I greatly appreciate the consistent honesty and customer service I've always received at Liberty Bay Auto.	I really appreciated all their help!	Take the time to scroll through the reviews and see how many 1 and 2 stars there are.	Most people might be discouraged to buy a new car, let alone a luxury car.	Or we have a lender ready to go if you put another 1000 down.	Never before had I ever had such an amazing car buying experience.	I also tried to take it back to have them check out the problem and they said they would drive it and it was never moved...	They charge an up front $120 diagnostic fee, and told me it is not deducted from the cost of repairs if you go forward with service -- in other words, just tack $120 extra on any repair that you have done here.	Granted we purchased a certified vehicle, but we walked out with a 7-year powertrain warranty and 2 years of free oil changes as part of the purchase price.	Bravo on the awesome decor and the welcoming environment amongst such an amazing assortment of exotics and collector cars.	We had a great experience at Enterprise Car Sales!	They made the process so simple and Alden even sent ME a thank you!	15 minutes later of searching and not knowing where he went, we finally connect.	We have real estate agents to find us houses and handle the negotiation impartially, why not  the same for cars?	Several un-returned phone calls and days later I take it in, it finaly got fixed.	I'm sad that Saabs are no longer being manufactured in Sweden for the US market, but grateful that Park Place is here to service my vehicle.	When I went in for financing it was within pennies of what Dominique quoted me.	I left, and was considering the Elantra.	They even knocked some money off the final price, due to some minor repairs it needed (windshield).	It was fun working with Marcee!	The blue book value for this exact car, in excellent condition is 11K.	It is without doubt that you will have a great experience like I did when looking for a car with Fin.	Dan is the absolute best.	I ended up trading in my 4runner and received KBB value for it which I was happy about.	You think something is weird, your instincts are out of place, just ask them why.. they're more than willing to tell you what's up and will prevent you from assuming and coming to a conclusion that will lead you to a negative experience.	Sounds pretty shady to me.	I came back at a later date because they had a car I was really interested in and dealt with James (who was very nice) but then  Scott "the manager" stepped in as we were filling out the paperwork and he informed me that because I was "associated" with someone who had written a bad review on Hertz that he wouldn't sell me a car.	The place is amazing looking.	Fin was very professional and very pleasant to deal with.	I never ONCE got a "shady" feel from this group.	When my teenager is ready for her first car in the next couple of years, Bellevue Auto House will be my first stop for sure and hopefully Sean can get her into her own Quattro!	Totally painless oil change for a reasonable price.	Was reassured the car was in great condition- "the cleanest car in the lot."	The 2011 is in AMAZING condition I have not had any issues with it since the day I have purchased it.	We appreciate it so much & are enjoying our new Kia!	I asked, "Why didn't you just leave a message about this?"	However, even knowing that, my next car will probably be a Mini.	On the way home this time, white smoke again.	You won't go wrong if you are looking for a car to upgrade to with these guys.	once in a while though, you find a guy who knows as much about cars or more and tells it straight.	I would recommend this dealer, it looks small from the road but I was very pleased with how my deal went down.	I pulled up onto the lot, where a mechanic was under the hood of another car.	At first, the car had a problem with the belt.	A huge Thank You to the whole staff at Seattle Motorsports for the best buying experience I have ever had.	Spent a day on it, fixed it for relatively cheap, and couldn't be more pleasant.	I felt safe in their hands.	So i drove it back and let him know what was still going on, so we all got into the car and he drove a few blocks to see if it was going to do it again, and guess what??	It took them a couple of days and they made it happen!	Well, lucky for you, you don't have to count us as a potential customer any longer.	I called my loan company to come get the car cause I'm not paying for a dime.	These guys had the car diagnosed before I handed them the keys to run the diagnosis (RED FLAG!).	I bought a 2013 Chevy Cruze here two weeks ago.	This is a very poor car sales yard.	My Saab will only be seen by Moe's from here on out!	When I arrived, it turned out I had a headlight and right brake light out.	The following day I went to see and check out Excellent Choice.	I recommend these guys to anyone and am confident that I have found the place to take good care of my car.	I recommend this dealership to my friends, family and to everybody.	This family run, father and son business is the BEST foreign auto repair/sales shop around!!!	Came here after consulting one of my Subaru friends, because my (only 4 year old) car has been burning oil.	PROFESSIONAL: From day one we knew when Heidi said she would call us with info, she would call us.	No BS -- list price was way better than I had found anywhere.	Bought my first car from this dealership.	In all fairness Toyota of Bellevue was very nice and very honest from the get-go and they never made promises to me they couldn't sleep so I was walked in with my eyes open and I am just waiting on Burien Chevrolet who had me come out after work no matter how tired I was last night with the pretense that I already been okayed to get a car and then they sent me away but I haven't heard back yet so maybe they'll come through ...what a shock that would be would make him the only car dealership they could keep their word in the neighborhood or maybe they'll just be like everybody else stay tuned!!!	The vehicle had some wear and tear, but what we expected for the year/price.	basically to summarize, they try to get ME to pay for the timing belt & some other belt because it needed to be fixed.	Should've come here first.	Here are a few examples:
  - One time I asked for an oil change + inspection, not knowing that an official inspection is different from the routine inspection that comes with an oil change.	I love this place, they have such good and honest people, Harry and Sunny are the most helpful people I know.	This place is absolutely fantastic!	Within 500 miles of driving the car I discovered a pre-existing problem with the steering rack and pinion, costing over $2,000 to fix.	I was very pleased with his service.	He wants/likes things done right and I don't see how anyone can say a single bad thing about him and his company.	I will use Matt in the future whenever I sell another car and have already recommended him to multiple friends that are trying to sell their own cars.	If that shop rag had been sucked into the motor the hole car would've been shot!	Their selection is very unique so it is fun just for visiting.	My husband and I are looking for a BMW X5, we WILL buy an X5.	Easiest, pleasant, no hassle buying experience we've ever had, that's why we're repeat buyers....	I called and let them know this but they did not offer to fix it.	Vera read me like a book, she saw right away that I knew what I wanted and that I knew a lot about cars in general.	I've been going to Superior for regular maintenance and repairs for almost 2 years, and I've gotten high quality, professional and friendly service every time.	But I would probably save your money and go else where!	When we came back to negotiate they were very reasonable, not at all pushy, gave us a very fair trade-in value and worked with us to structure the deal in a way that worked for our finances.	In the meantime within a week of buying the car it had rained for the first time, and we came out and found our seats soaked as the sunroof leaked.	It was in fantastic condition.	He promised to send the person who referred me a 100$ gas card , so I told them to expect it and guess what?	Very clean and organized.	He even taught my kids algebra while waiting for the paper work.. ^_^

Great service!	Fuck that guy Bob.	I'll never take my truck back to Toyota of Seattle though.	He was very knowledgeable and gladly answered any questions I had.	Ed's an awesome guy and you can tell he puts his heart and soul into his place Superior Motors.	Was it different than CL?	They have quite good collection including bmw, benz & porche.	From day 1 this car has gave me nothing but trouble.	If I wanted a reliable car, I would go buy a Honda.	I just had to meet, sign the papers, and drive the truck away.	I would recommend all of my friends and family to go here.	About six months ago I first visited this dealership.	"You can come over now," the guy said.	So review update 2months after getting my car from this place I realized wow I got taken for a ride !	The guys at Drive Auto Center are awesome!	Heads turn, the car growls, it's a blast to drive, and my bank account isn't crying.	The way he treated me shows poor and lack of customer service on his behalf.	These guys tried and tried to find the parts but could not.	Things started really going downhill when I pointed out that the carfax history they had printed in their "get to know me" book was different than what I saw online.	I'm not sure what happened with the other reviewers that gave negative remarks, but it sure doesn't sound like the same business that I went to.	I came into the Renton car sales as a first time car buyer.	Thanks for that atleast scumbags.	He called me and was very honest and clear about what he recommended.	For a mere $1500 we left Park Place with all new tires (premium grade!)	A very lesson learned.	Thank you Robert for making this a good experience for us without being pushy or pressuring us.	This used to be a good place but sadly it's not anymore .I will send everyone I know to car pros in renton !	He said point blank that he's going to run a few checks and see what he can do... not what he CAN'T do.	I drop the truck off Tuesday night and don't expect a follow up until maybe Thursday afternoon.	We are legit customers, and we were treated like absolute garbage.	Absolute rubbish.	Overall, there are better car dealerships that'll help you find the right Volvo for you and you should go this route because this business want your patronage.	Jay spent a lot of time answering questions around what parts they use and pricing and was very patient while I shopped around to get quotes for some work on our Audi Q5.	We went to another dealership before this one but we were happy we ended up here.	Already having had enough of this place, I left my keys and a note with a copy of our receipt saying "no ones here, it's 8:04 I have a flight to catch call me" then as our taxi arrived the guy working showed up.	I am furious that she fell prey to predatory lending and am going to look into your company closely.	They'll love a visit here!	So this part of the review is the 5-star part.	We called Hertz 6x and emailed Joe at least that many.	I went to Bob Beyers to look at a used Volvo XC 70 and 90.	Overall experience the owners are running a bad business.	When my trusty old car had finally reached the point of costing more in repairs than it was worth, it was time to think about getting a new-to-me car.	For myself, it was my second time looking at BMWs and I was not disappointed.	Oh, and the price I paid - an excellent deal.	Great service, quick, and not too expensive!	They were quick to respond and very respectful to however I wanted to approach things.	Thanks Serj

I was looking at both a RAV4 and an Outback.	When we went over the finance paperwork she repeatedly pressured us to buy expensive warranties and was very rude and snide when we declined.	I have forgotten the salespersons name but I enjoyed working with him.	No headaches, no hassles, much respect.	I'm shocked at the lack of customer service and dependability.	I paid to fix something on my brakes in my truck and as soon as I left there same issue.	We bought our first family car, a 2009 Ford Focus from Jeff.	Well, sorry, Sean, I wasn't aware that as a car salesmen SELLING A CAR was considered wasting your time.	Once this PI catches the bandit, celebrate with pie.	Two weeks later and guess what?	The people working there were very friendly and genuinely took interest in helping me.	I will be recommending Enterprise and Mandy to anyone who is looking to purchase a vehicle as well as be returning for my own future car purchases.	He is always extremely fair and you never feel like you are getting the up sale from these guys.	We bought our second Nissan Leaf here and Fin had all the paperwork done in short order.	The owner and manager are honest, friendly, and genuinely care for the safety and satisfaction of their customers.	We experienced that pictures (and salesmen) can be very deceiving, and that is where Auto Quest stood apart from the rest, and also where our hunt for the perfect vehicle ended.	This entire car buying experience was beyond amazing.	I had been pre-qualified and we compared rates with what he had available and he beat the rate I had been quoted from BECU.	and ask if this was a common issue.	First search brought up several forums of Subaru owners facing the same problem after jumping their batteries.	I did not wind up selling my car here for logistical reasons, but Fin was thorough, honest, communicative, and easy to talk to.	I wouldn't get our cars fixed from anywhere else nor would I buy a car from anywhere else!!	I waited a week before returning and choose the car I wanted.	Clearly these guys don't understand the value of a relationship and prioritize money over service.	In all, I simply went with the oil change and a drive belt replacement (also done early), and didn't opt for anything else.	Considering the oil hasn't been changed for 6 months, I'm assuming the "seep" is exactly that, but you know, clarification would have been good customer service.	Always super nice, fair and honest.	I went in last week to check out a car I have been wanting for a year now!	Their add says they have a no pressure sales team, and that is the truth!	Steve has always been a professional.	Justin came out, introduced himself then gave me time to look around on my own.	Great deals and unmatched customer service.	No dealing with slimy dealers.	In my one minute inspection I found about four other problems which I won't bore you with.	Now they won't return our calls.	I had a major car problem after driving from CA to Seattle for Christmas (and waaaaaaayyy beyond).	Total rip off its a very inexpensive part and labor shouldn't be more than 2 hours.	Also, any time I took my Mini in for Service it was a good experience as they were extremely helpful.	His reply is, we run a lot of people's credit.	I purchased a 2005 dodge 2500 from millennium for 30gs
1 week after the heater core went out, they didn't help one bit after asking.	I went to Heidi pretty much knowing what I wanted but not wanting to deal with the hassle of going to different dealers and trying to negotiate price.	Took it to three different mechanics they all said that the part wasn't the right fit.	I beelined to APX Auto Brokers and was approached by people who are very knowledgeable with enthusiast cars.	I do still feel that we spent a lot of time and effort for this purchase.	Asked about vehicle condition and was told, "We had the car checked out".	They have found spare(used) parts for me like an essentially new back seat for my 2005 which my dogs had soiled.	They'll treat you right.	I was told they didn't make much money off used cars, and that just because there were dents on the catalytic converter, it did not mean there was damage on the inside.	I'll tell you why:

It completely depends on who you get.	He helped me understand the the differences between the various models of both new and certified used cars, including their features and differing warranties.	My best car buying experience ever.	2 Stars for having Mike on your team.	Dominique and his staff are great; low key, respectful and dare I say of a car dealership: genuine.	In terms of the service, the work performed on the car was perfect.	BUYER BEWARE: DO NOT BUY HERE!	Make sure you say "hello" to his dog Aiko when you visit.	I drove off the lot, after being pressured into an over priced car and instantly, MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS CAME ON.	Mr Wang has a great selection of vehicles!	I highly recommend Seattle Mini and working with Jay and Alae!	I haven't bought a car in 8 years & last time I did, I felt it was stressful since people were pressuring me on buying cars & having to negotiate.	I highly recommend this place to anyone.	For about a week, we discussed (via email) trading my car plus cash for a nice 4x4 on the lot.	Seriously the best and easiest car buying experience I've ever experienced.	The owner/manager is completely rude and unprofessional.	Very helpful to find the best used car.	Dan is reliable and timely, working overtime on Sunday so I had my car for work on Monday.	I highly recommend this car dealer ship to everyone!	Being a Lake Forest Park resident it is always nice to support your local businesses.	I bought a nice looking BMW convertible, they hemmed and hawed when I pointed out that the top didn't work - seriously, a convertible that doesn't .... convert.	If you're downtown, or in the south end, it's a much easier trek.	It looks freshly clean.	She just handed our envelope back to us and said, "ok.	He told us that he really appreciates his boss because he doesn't run the place like a "normal" used car lot.	This is not necessarily a bad thing if you like a more organic, or even bohemian, car repair experience, but it's certainly one to be aware of if you've never dealt with them before.	I had a great experience purchasing my BMW 335D from Zac and Dominic.	The Toyota certification requires, among other things, 2 working keys.	At the time i wasnt to aware of credit but as i got some knowledge i went back and reviewed all the paperwork and realized i had been screwed by this place.	You get certified used cars with very low mileage and clean titles that have been extremely well taken care of with no haggling, no high-pressure sales tactics and no pushy back-end upsells.	Normally I had Greg's Japanese do most of the major service work, but last year I wasnt happy with some of the service they did so I made the mistake of taking to Toyota of Seattle.	When I feel it's time for something else , I see what they've got on their lot .	They are not trustworthy!	The guy that came out  to help us, Rob, was very nice, laid back, not pushy.	Troll Motors was extremely thorough and pointed out things I wouldn't have noticed - both cosmetic and functionally.	I arrived for my 7am appointment and they were ready to go.	She made the much dreaded necessity of buying a new car a painless process.	But that's another review.	I ran into Drive Auto Center on my walk and decided to meander.	Considering that I spent $650 already with zero success, that they wanted $142 to even look at the car, that I could be at the dealer much of the day with no loaner (I was told that the 8 am appointment was really just a drop off time), I simply asked for my keys back.	=D

Women owned and operated.	I've bought new cars and used cars, if you're looking for an affordable, new-to-you car, this is the place to go.	After going over the numbers with her, she would go to her finance manager herself, no bullying from him trying to "make a deal."	Found some issues to be fixed and was dealt with promptly.	Two days later the tire pressure monitoring system went of for low air in the spare.	I will start by saying that I've bought 3 cars from David and Wendy already.	These guys saw my advertisement and called me; from that moment until cashing my check has been a  perfect customer service experience.	After spending an afternoon sitting in traffic and getting this done, I brought the car back to APX ready to make an offer.	The staff is very unprofessional and unfair.	Robb is the best!!	I'm happy to say the second replacement clutch, while still not seeming quite as good as the factory original, is much better than the first one they installed.	Very dishonest people.	I purchased a truck with these guys and couldn't be more pleased.	Working with Fin was a delightfully refreshing experience.	Hmm, so I called to schedule service and asked about a loaner.	Prior to this, we had a walk through with a service advisor and we did not see any of those.	Customer service is second to none.	I am looking forward to continue my relationship with Carter Subaru by having my Impreza serviced there.	and followed several months later was a repair to my Engine.	I had a problem with this company about a week ago.	I wanted to get it checked out by a mechanic however it was a Sunday and my mechanic was not working.	The owner Dan seemed straightforward, but his gruffness and abrasiveness are a total turnoff.	Oh and guess what?	Toni and Prudent really put a smile on our faces and our butts back on the road.	It was cold and I was soaked and the first thing I was asked when I came in was if I wanted a cup of coffee or tea.	I found this unacceptable as it was a brand-new clutch and I did nothing wrong to cause this.	- Our car battery died over the weekend and we installed a new battery ourselves.	I bought mine 9 months ago and I'm still really happy with what I got.	We did look online first and knew which vehicles we were interested in before we even got to the lot.	I did not end up purchasing from this dealer so I can't speak for the purchasing process.	I've since purchased another car from a more traditional "luxury brand" dealership, and while not exceptionally awful, that experience reminded me how great Park Place really is compared to the others out there.	I asked to drive one of the Volvos I'd been interested in and again, I was handed the keys and told to have fun.	All I can suggest is do your due diligence before buying a car anywhere you go.	The sales department is about as helpful, knowledgeable and straighforward as I've ever seen at a car dealership.	I also used to take my Dodge Durango to their company mechanic and his exact words to me were you bought a lemon you might as well sell it and take the loss and this was told to me less than a week after getting the truck his name was Amir

I bought a car from these gentleman and It is already broken and i have to buy another one I have only had this car for 5-6 months.	I felt my car was somewhat overpriced and tried to haggle, and ended up walking out without the car.	Sam and Richard were great!	Several weeks after the initial repair, my car was idling rough - really rough.	He shows us a few cars and we test drive a basic Focus.	And I ask again "can I please have the last pages?"	Highly recommended, and next time I need a car this is the place where I'll go.	The collection is absolutely amazing!	I've been here a few times, but the last time I went in, things did not go well.	2/5, car is good but don't expect any support after the sale.	You would think a professional "Subaru Advisor" would have been able to be of a little more assistance for a long time customer.	They both really make an effort to help out the customer.	They looked around for one for me, but after a month or so just ordered one for me.	Isaac  and Craig have always been helpful and all the staff there is super nice and helpful.	it took 3 weeks but damn it was worth the wait!!	I would not return or recommend them.	I wouldn't trust my Saab to anyone else!	We will definitely go back to Sam for our next car.	I went to take out my wallet, and he said it's okay.	That tells me the cars were all in great shape for the price I paid and each transaction was a mutually beneficial negotiation and deal for both parties.	STEER CLEAR of bait and switch!!!	I've been putting off buying a car for so long because I dislike how pushy salesmen at car dealerships are.	I got a high quality car for much less than I could have got from a Nissan dealer.	This truck was so bad that it constituted a waste of me and my family's time driving all the way there, and is an insulting waste of time.	I've gotten so many compliments on my dodge challenger.	I'll never shop Carter again, and will encourage anyone who wants to to reconsider.	Ashlee

Just had an oil change done.	Great staff, great cars and great customer service, buy your next car here, I know I will.	Robert's office is not plush, but I'd rather have a decent deal than a fancy waiting room.	Jon sent me an email with important information about my vehicle then came to the waiting room to review the diagnostics results on my car.	This review has been needed for a while.	Backstory: My Subaru Forester battery died over night because a door was left ajar and the dome light was on during that period.	Also, I appreciate its family owned and run and they offered me coffee, tea or water every time!	The dealers seemed to have little interest in returning calls, providing consistent information or frankly in making a sale.	The tires had great tred on them.	-Nick

This place is awesome.	Then we discovered there was a leak in the exhaust.	He even offered to fix the struts for free (if we pay for the parts) and replaced the battery that kept dying (with a battery from another used car)
 
And now the cons:
1.	And when we had it checked out, it was just as their inspection, no issues.	I was communicating long distance and they helped me out with the sale, the commute from the airport, and shipping after all was said and done.	They were very nice and sensed I was coming in there frustrated and were able to turn it around so I was in a better mood.	People here are nice, reliable and helpful.	It even had a full tank when I left!	Worst customer service I have ever experienced.	On 2/13/2013, purchased a used vehicle from Championship Motors.	But everything else seemed nice.	Great dealership that really knows enthusiast cars.	Crappy customer service.	My recommendation to anybody that comes to this car lot needs to have the car taking off the lot to a mechanic and having it completely checked out before you lose all your money.	I called Moe's to see how much they'd charge to fix a leaking trunk.	Fin is really great to work with!	What a contrast to the awful, high pressure, rip-off experience we had buying my husband's car at a Japanese dealership a few years ago.	I bring both my Toyotas here for servicing, and it's always a painless affair to get in and out.	It was the perfect car for us, and the buying experience was great!	We were able to take our car away and are extremely happy with the process and price.	Pat was quick and professional, and they were able to find financing for about what my credit union could offer so I could be out the door that night.	Molds also started growing in between the seats, seatbelts, cup holders, and some part of the ceiling.	I have definitely learned my lesson!	Fin is a BMW guy, he knows a lot about them and his family all drives them.. he pointed out details on the car I wouldn't even had looked for.	Marcee ended up getting the vehicle from another dealer out of state for $496 less than what one Seattle-area dealer offered (still saving me money when I took into account her fee and my time savings), $1825 less than using USAA Buyer's program, and several hundred dollars less than Costco's program (you think you are getting a deal until you add on the dealer's automatic and allowed markup under the program).	This Dealer is awesome I purchased my Honda Accord here today and it was fast and easy, curt the owner was here and help me with my purchase.	:)

I've been meaning to write a review for this place...Kisha is such a sweatheart!	It's also available to download for free if you go to cbcreditking.com.	My investment is on its last legs--I have to get an oil change, and tires rotated, or it's not safe.	Last year,  I purchased my car here...like other reviews say, no pressure sales approach, reasonable prices, the whole experience was pleasant and smooth.	Bought a Saab at Paramount Motors a year ago.	Went in to look at a late model BMW and drove away extremely satisfied.	He does an excellent job educating you about what is wrong with your car, gives you high and low estimates, offers you high and low end parts, but always gives his very honest opinion about what is best for your car.	Thanks Enterprise Sales and God Bless!!!	Because of my family's long relationship with the Gene Mayer, I have complete faith in the backstory of the vehicles and in the condition of the vehicles.	I just pick the phone and call them!	6) 2 hours before our appointment to get the car I get a call from Jeff saying there was a problem.	So I ask if I can see the other pages.	When i finally paid the car off they called to offer me "great deals" on another car.	they were family people, i bought the car for my daughter and grand daughter and they were very friendly and kind.	On the appointment date, I met with Ally who is an assistant of David.	He was fabulously patient and knowledgeable.	TRUSTWORTHY: See above.	We were shown a 2015 Pathfinder worth 24k+ with torn seats not to mention dog hair throughout the entire vehicle (let's talk about the cosmetic wear from the dog paws apparent on the back of the car - ok, let's not).	I drove off the same day in a 2000 VOLVO S70 with 98,000 miles on it!	Even made a couple visits in person.	Again not that bad of a fix but the shop continued to tell me that the transmission, which was recently serviced, is going to go eventually.	And it was awesome.	It's a no/low haggle lot.	***We HIGHLY recommend this place!	Specifically, Rob was fantastic!	Long story short- I came in to look at a benz that was advertised as having an extended warranty that came with it.	This is why; high quality inventory with full auto history available in minutes on every car.	I was never given my temporary registrations and a couple weeks later, I actually got a call telling me that my paperwork had not been done correctly and I needed to come back in if I wanted them to order my plates.	I think that the sales experience we had far exceeded our expectations for any auto dealership.	We called Jorge Ruiz and told him of our situation.	My wife is very particular and these guys were able to make her happy and feel good about the purchase.	I bought my 2nd vehicle from here just the other week.	THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOR A CAR ADVERTISED FOR 6,400 They had me do my review before I left the lot.	The air bag light comes on randomly and stays on, there is a light that says "tire monitor fault" that comes on after driving a certain distance all the time, one of the heated seats (driver) doesn't work, the rear defrost doesn't work, and there is a grinding/squeaky noise that it makes when I don't even brake, just as a take off sometimes.	I'll recommend you to everyone.	Honest, no pressure and quick.	They drove me home and because of traffic had Uber being me back when the car was ready which saved me time!	Dan Lee and Kelli Daniels are the definition of superior customer service.	I've had my truck for about a year and I've already put in about $6,000 in repairs.	He quit because of how poorly he was treated so my payments were now taken over by the other workers and they tried have me pay way more than was agreed and interest was not part of the deal.	We purchased every extra protection package under the sun when we bought our Mini there, but I'm always getting into a debate with them as to whether certain things are covered, when I was just serviced for the same thing a few visits ago.	My friends are getting tired of hearing what a great experience it was.	Joe and Jim from Renton Enterprise car sales was courteous and very professional.	I have a 2007 Saab 93 and have had trouble finding a reliable, honest and reasonably priced shop to work on my car, since I moved to Seattle.	Besides my hometown mechanic's shop, this is the only garage I've been where they didn't try to upsell me on additional services while I was there -- a pleasant surprise.	Trevin says "I have no idea what is going on."	Kept me up to speed on progress of sale and honest assessments for value.	I worked with Mandy Randev, who was an amazing salesman.	My dad and I drove in the lot & saw how small it was not knowing they had an even bigger lot behind the entrance so we decided to go elsewhere.	I just relocated to Seattle and Heidi helped me to get the car I wanted!	I unexpectedly had to buy a car and was not looking forward to the normal car buying experience of wheeling and dealing and getting pressured to buy.	I admit that I was briefly a little bit worried when he said that there were no cars available in their system that fit our criteria (due to bad previous experiences I've had with other car dealerships being really pushy about upgrading in the past), but he never once told us that our only option was to get a more expensive car like others have done elsewhere - he simply laid out all available options and timelines for getting what we wanted, let us decide what we wanted to do, and did not try to influence the decision.	I got back and was told that they were "generously" charging me a ridiculous interest rate and wouldn't be giving me my AAA discount on the car.	My car was listed at $2000 below blue book.	Owners , Alan and other they were so rude and arrogant.	He was very friendly and fair and honest, our transaction was easy and enjoyable, and we love our new (to us) car.	Went to Championship Motors with the pictures of the damage and to discuss this problem.	We did a lot of research online and found that Armadillo had great reviews so we decided to check it out.	After this I will not buy a car anywhere else.	Go somewhere else.	My only problem is that they hiked the price above the kelley blue book fair value, though they gave me a great trade in offer so I suppose it's a toss up.	That was a pleasant car buying experience and this is definitely a 5 star car dealership.	thanks

This is the worst place to get a car.	Overall this place is shady.	Well, it's been over 6 months since the purchase & this Forester has been basically flawless.	Easy, painless transaction.	Mike and I took the car for a test drive, he told me more about the car and where it came from.	They also let me take the truck for a few hours so I could drop it off for a pre-purchase inspection at a shop near my house.	I brought it up to them and he said "our mechanics check for safety issues we didn't see any we were concerned about" ok last I checked, oil leaking from the motor is dangerous, you need tail lights I drive legally on the road, and having the tie rod bent out of place which caused wearing out the front tires to the point where the steel was sticking out makes my car dangerous.	I was filled with trepidation at the idea of buying my own car but this experience was painless, chill, and lots of fun!	Phil was also instrumental in arranging for the car to be shuttled over to DaisyWagen, a Volvo-only repair shop, for a pre-buy inspection.	I bought a 2014 BMW 535d fully loaded.	I worked with Tyler to purchase my FIRST car ever and he was beyond helpful, professional, and polite!	I explained where I was and he told me to hurry up because they were done.	We recently purchased a used 2006 Mini Cooper S from Finesse Auto Sales.	She brought the keys right out, got us all set up for a test drive, and was pleasant and easy to talk to.	I've had nothing but positive experiences with them over the years both buying and selling cars, and in the service department.	He's a true car enthusiast and had a vast product knowledge.	Shocking that all occurred without me having to order a bunch of stuff and wait seven days.	We were encouraged to come back in the next day or two, as, we were told, a number of new cars were expected in, including a Cobalt, which is a model in which my husband had expressed a particular interest.	The Enterprise Car Rental place (who were also great) referred us to Enterprise Car Sales after we got a rental there to hold us over.	They have cared for our Mercedes, Audi and BMW's.	"I've got a 2009 Jetta with a low tire pressure warning and I think it's a puncture," I told them.	Robert also gave me a fair trade in price for my Infiniti G37 and Andrew secured a pretty low interest rate for financing, which I didn't get even from my own credit union.	AGAIN, I was deliberately misled by another Enterprise "Manager" who flat lied to me.	I found a Subaru Legacy online at Highland Auto and thought the price was borderline too good to be true.	Thanks again Chris and Jim

I had such a stress free experience with enterprise car sales in Renton.	We gave her our budget and she came out a little over, but ultimately found us a great car for the $$.	The first couple of times I went in things were fine, but after this last visit, I don't feel confident going there anymore.	He simply asked what I was looking for and was honest about the pricing.	I live in Beacon Hill and it's so nice to have a mechanic in my neighborhood who I can trust and treats people well.	I had noticed the high quality of work that was alway leaving this business and thought we'd give them a try after our Eurovan was stolen and we wanted to get it feeling like new ASAP.	NO call, but we got an email and we had one hard inquiry hit from a financial institute.	I'm glad that I bought this Camry as my first car.	What a breath of fresh air to buy a car from Enterprise!	Today, I had the most unpleasant phone conversation with Denny Hynes who is the Used Car Director.	And then when approached on it stopped taking phone calls, stopped replyng to emails.	All the staff was very helpful, honest, and straightforward...	The good news: the brakes are in *great* shape.	Do your home work.	We just moved into the neighborhood and are looking for a great mechanic to take care of our Toyotas.	Billy did seem friendly and easy going.	Will still go to this dealership if I have more needs.	Eventually though, after realizing the problem wasn't going away, I took it back and asked them to take a look to see if it needed adjustment or if there was some other problem.	He guaranteed his work and since I live out of town said that if something went wrong in the next year he'd buy the part and ship it to wherever I was so that he could stand behind his work.	All things I would consider if presented, but no counters at all.	Anthony & Winsome W.

Easy going, low pressure approach, cars are above average quality, fair pricing....
Long term employee, Robert, hard to find in this business, must be doing something right...

Never purchased a rental car but did much research before selecting Enterprise.	Rick was awesome, and honestly everyone I got to talk to in this place was awesome.	No hassle, low pressure paperwork.	If you have a Saab that needs work I would highly recommend contacting these guys before you pay too much at another shop.	Ugh, frustrating.	Thank you ECA... you made my car buying experience a GREAT one!	Don't waste your time!	They were all polite and helpful.	Bought a used 2013 Mini Cooper from Seattle Mini this weekend and delighted to report that I had a very pleasant experience with Peter and his team.	He certainly didn't have to.	He even told us that only about $30-40 actually gets used on labor and mailing of our documents.	and some touch-up paint for the scratches in the deal, and we walked away with the car of our dreams at the price we wanted.	The car price was exactly in line with what I expected based on research.	I've found that a lot more people generally only comment on bad situations here on Yelp vs good ones.	By far the best experience I've ever had buying an automobile.	All seemed good.	It's been a year and I have not had one problem with the vehicle.	Their service department is a real hassle: checking in was difficult/lengthy; they are dis-organized; shuttle service is not convenient.	It was an estimated 2 hour wait, but Honda was quick and ended a half hour early.	I highly recommend EBA to anyone looking to purchase a car.	I check out the car I like, head to the door.	The service was good.	The first car I seen was the Honda we ended up purchasing.	I was quoted on 15 minutes to finish paperwork to get my car, but the salesman had me there for 3+ hours because he kept leaving to try and make sales.	Much like James, Denny most likely won't give a lick about a crap car they sold.	Got us the best trade-in they could for my husband's car.	That would have been a red flag, except that I had two other people recommend the same mechanic who had nothing to do with the dealership.	Save yourself the hassle, buy your car somewhere else.	We even got an extra key (he ordered us the fancy new one!)	Today I was met with the utmost courtesy and dignity when arriving at this establishment.	Apparently they hold pretty loose schedules so plan your work thats to be done in advance if possible.	Well, I don't mean to put my business out there, but after a messy divorce and a brief stint of unemployment, my credit had to be rebuilt.	While buying a car is never particularly fun, Toyota of Seattle made it as painless as I've come to expect.	My husband and I bought a car through Sunnyside and Seattle Metropolitan Credit Union financed my loan.	Want to sell your car?	I called and requested to hold it.	Not wanting to be totally empty-handed, we pulled into Honda of Seattle to see an HR-V.	I just got home with my new (used) dream car purchased from Armadillo Auto Sales.	No BS and straight to the point.	We weren't expecting to actually buy the car on the day we ended up getting it, but Craig was very accommodating, coming in on his day off and staying late to complete the paperwork.	Though it's always good to know those numbers.	In many parts of Asia and India, you'll see brands of cars which shouldn't be on the road anywhere, hahaha.	She has no incentive to entice you to buy "more".	I called a friend to drive me home as all their loners were out and they were very apologetic about that.	I purchased an immaculate BMW and couldn't be happier.	You might end up getting your identity jacked.	Guess who's never buying a car here again?	Isaac found us a great rate for a loan and explained all of our options.	He drives his cars until their last leg, so it was definitely time for an upgrade and he loves his new Hyundai SantaFe!	6 Dealerships in total, 8 different cars, and 4 horrible experiences.	I've been doing some maintenance on the truck and the guys at Millennium have been more than helpful in their recommendations and even getting me better prices for things I want done.	More recently, after a car breaking down, it ended up at another shop first.	I was surprised to find that even though Auto Quest is a luxury dealership they still have a large selection of modest cars as well.	Thank you Peter and Tucker for delivering what "used car buying" should be.	Josh got my car squared away for me quickly and I couldn't have asked for a better experience!	Made a long trip up to W&D at the end of the day to look at a 2011 Outback.	These guys know what they're doing.	Russ is the man super friendly best salesman I've dealt with I would advise using him!	I thought at the time, "Wow, that's an interesting business idea.	Well, I have been car shopping the last few weeks and I must say I have a whole new grasp on what car salesmen are like unfortunately I can't say it's good!!	I had the pleasure of buying a 2014 Toyota Corolla from Jason at Toyota of Seattle recently.	However one of their cars caught my eye so I decided to check it out.	From what the mechanic told me, a seal used somewhere between the engine and the transmission is not even a seal but actually some sort of compound that was used in place of the seal, which over time will deteriorate and get caught in the transmission somehow, causing it to fail.	They made the entire experience awesome, unlike other dealerships out there.	On Tuesday, I called back and spoke with Robert, not knowing he was the finance guy and asked about our application, he then said, Austin is out with a potential buyer and he will have him call me.	Each time I've found the car I've been searching for, and each time the car sold itself.	I have been bringing my BMW here for years and have been more than satisfied with the service!	Mandy Randev got back to me that they would be able to move the car if I were interested and we made an appointment for a couple days out to have time to have the vehicle moved.	I got awesome financing and a super warranty because they took the time to make sure I got the best deal that  would work for me.	The sales people helped me real good they knew their stuff,  and I left happy

While I had some initial problems at first, everything worked out with them.	If you go here, go see Chris K. Lee.	Now this is what I call a car buying experience!	He replied we didn't know until your credit was run.	Definitely not the typical "car salesman".	They are very reasonably priced, friendly, personable, talented and can be trusted -- something rare in the world of mechanics.	If you like a car of his, buy it fast because his cars do not stay around for long!	This was by far my best experience I've had buying a car.	I was confused about why he needed my insurance... until he handed me the key and said to have fun.	But during the paperwork and final numbers process there were so surprise fees or weird suspicious things that I feel like one typical encounters at dealers.	They have a friendly staff and a well equipped, clean waiting area.	I just moved from New York to Washington a few days ago and this was also my first time leasing a car; so as you can imagine I was very clueless about pretty much everything.	The car is in great condition, and I've been driving it smoothly for a year.	), got it down to Jeep, and had them fix it!	Beamer would force you to buy their cars right away and Merk would simple kick you out of the store.	In December I needed a new alternator and he put it in.	5 minutes later he comes back and says they'll call me tomorrow because this part takes time.	Love Heidi, love my car@

Heidi is actually "amazing" just like her company name says!	Working with James and his team to purchase a used car is a breeze.	We sent the application in on December 26th 2015.	It's fun and funky.	I am still waiting to wake up.	I would recommend Honda of Seattle & Jonathan in the future.	He went above and beyond what is expected and even changed the battery and other things on the car for us.	The car hadn't been detailed but I knew the car was well equipped.	I was interested in a Subaru that ended up being way in the back of the lot but four cars were moved just so I could take it for a spin.	The pricing is average, but the customer service exceptional.	They put up with our two year old running around for hours as I looked and my husband watched her, and interacted with her to help keep her entertained.	I have now bought 2 vehicles from them and I have had excellant customer service always.	While I called Ian to try to get my truck in, he walked me through a few steps over the phone to see if my truck would start before bringing it in.	Speaking of repairs the used automobile that I spent $2,000 on a warranty and paid the $200 deductible to have the transmission repaired.	I had three weeks of rental coverage from evil State Farm which tried to nickel and dime me on what the vehicle was worth.	There was no pressure from Cliff.	All I know if that it was fine before the oil change and now it wasn't fine.	I am just as enthusiastic about the experience now, as I was then.	-Ashley G.

I've only had good experiences here.	Must be a really great place to work at.	Every employee there was attentive, courteous and clearly hard working.	He was such a sweetheart!	Other places I've gotten my car detailed would just move stuff to the side and cleaned around it, but Legend Auto neatly put everything in a box which also helped organize my trunk.	Worst car lot ever and the workers are awful.	But they offered both at a great value.	When we came back the next day to make an offer on the car, she got us the deal we were looking for.	The waiting room had wifi and TV, and bathroom around the corner.	So I will have paid FOUR THOUSAND $$$ MORE than the car is actually worth.	Awesome telephone communication for days leading up to my purchase.	These rub on the tires if you turn sharp such as pulling in to a parking spot or a u turn.	Things to know before you arrive:
Bring your driver's license and proof of insurance.	other used car lots would have charged $3-$4K more for this car.	As a petite blonde woman who obviously knows very little about her car, I was pleasantly surprised to be treated with kindness and respect - he didn't make me feel stupid, come up with a bunch of bogus charges, hit on me, blow me off, or talk down to me.	I have to agree with with Chelsea J.  I went in to look at a 4Runner that the dealer had posted on craigslist as well as on their website.	As you glance at the 5 star reviews, I don't need to write another 300 words to describe how incredible she was.	I called ahead to ask about a specific vehicle and when I arrived they had it running with the A/C on.	Give these guys a look, check out their nice inventory and I'm sure you will be returning customers also!	My parents and I went there on a Saturday morning at 10 am and right away Archie came over to ask us how he could help us.	Read other yelp reviews of Platinum Wholesale Autos saying that it's a good shop to sell a car without any extra hassle.	Professional and friendly.	Usually it's customary to put a full tank of gas in a car, the gas light was on within 30 minutes of my drive home.	I reluctantly agree.	We stopped in weekly until our insurance settlement claim was paid, had specific needs and were probably overly selective, and test drove several cars before we had the money to get one.	Anyway, nobody there mistreated me, and they were friendly, but they wasted a ton of my time, for a truck that you would be crazy to pay $2000 for, least of all $12,000.	I was in shock.. i about flipped out on her.	I really can't say enough about Bill and the whole crew.	I spend a lot of my time out of the country so it doesn't make sense for me to keep an expensive STI around anymore.	Since he is out today, he said he booked it with Chris Evans.	They take their time to pick well-running cars and if anything is wrong with them, they fix it before they sell it, and after that, if something goes wrong, they give reduced rates on in-house labor.	Worst place ever!	I will buy another rig here, no question about it.	Instead I just felt ignored.	Then a friend told us about Heidi.	Oh, and the car didn't need any further repairs.	He relayed all important info/documents from the previous owners so it felt like dealing with a private owner, with the added benefit of a professional inspection and service.	Sam was very friendly and informative.	Our new dealership tells us to go back and get our refund for the Gap Coverage & Extended Warranty (that's when we discovered that they added it to our vehicle back in '14).	Yeah, I know, that's why the passenger side door was left open.	I am a customer for life!!	Carter is pretty awesome for a car dealer but this review is really more about the experience working with the salesperson Marissa.	1:15 rolls around and a guy comes in and helps the four of us that we're waiting for our cars.	There was another person that helped with our transaction.	I was pretty queued up at that point and demanded that the car go to a reputable dealership to get fixed, Bellevue BMW.	After relocating to San Diego from Seattle  I quickly  realized that my previous car (V8 4runner) was not cut out for my work commute.	Obviously the cars are used and not new so there were things to work on , but their service department is there to help.	Living in CA I was nervous of buying a car sight unseen, so I was pleased when both Atticus and Sonora answered every question I had in a timely manner.	Being a first time car buyer I did A LOT of research before buying, which every car owner should do.	Dropped someone off at the airport early in the morning, was stuck in town waiting for an appt, and needed an oil change.	Few minutes later we made the deal.	The car performed well during my 4 hours trip to Portland.	Went there two weeks ago for a check engine light they charged 600.00 to replace the thermostat.	It almost felt degrading.	They answered questions in person, on the phone and by email.	But I bet you these people have good hearts.	what wonderful service?	Its quite obvious that this dealer has no commitment to its customers, No amount of explaining will justify this lack of customer service
***End EDIT***
There's so many reasons why I would recommend against anyone visiting the Toyota of Seattle for repair and service work.	If you're in the market for a vehicle, I'd say check out SS.	I will definitely go to them again in the future.	I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good used car.	I bought a car from here.	She kept us up to date with everything going on in the negotiations.	Very friendly and gave me a good deal all around.	Then, I scheduled an appointment with David for a test drive.	Ed and Andy knows their craft and they're very transparent and that's hard to find in other dealerships.	Jorge was very accommodating to my wife and kids and took the time to address all of our questions.	But they take off with the paperwork I was reviewing.	The car I purchased was not certified; all vehicles there are sold "as is."	It took a few weeks for the car to get there, a few minor repairs and certified.	The car buying experience (paperwork and all) was a lot more smooth and straightforward than we expected in terms of paperwork - sign, hand over the check, return for plates, done.	We're happy and will recommend others!	*Then* they walked me through the whole point to point inspection that they did while I was gone and assured me that everything is okay.	Professional sales person and they were very patient with my 2 year old running around with me for the entire process.	Ed gave me a great deal on my purchase and made everything super easy for me.	I know, most car lots on Aurora are like that, but I don't have any experience with them.	Here's how it works: For our transaction, I simply told Heidi the exact car I wanted (model trim, options and color).	Not only did he spend a half hour past closing on his Friday doing a thorough job checking everything, he only charged $85.00 and adamantly refused to let me pay him extra for getting me in with no notice, and staying past closing.	Thumbs up to an comfortable clean environment, we're sure we'll be back and send referrals too.	In a corner there were video games for our kids to play.	Sean who was helping us directly was very friendly and helpful.	Their waiting room experience was pleasant, they have a big flat screen tv comfy couch and endless magazines.	Incredibly rude, profound, salesman used profanities towards me.	Sold a vehicle here, traded in a vehicle, and bought a used vehicle.	That's awesome news to me and a great turnaround.	At least I had a tire patched and was given a loaner vehicle.	I was recommended to this place by a tow truck driver that said his customers had said great thingsabout this place.	I got told no at several others places and at Super America it seemed like they really cared about getting me into a car.	I purchased my Mercedes here about a year ago.	No harm, no foul, but I walked away with a sour feeling.	I guess they figured no one would look under the fabric vanity cover??	He told me he would never allow someone to buy an unsafe or unsound vehicle.	Victor Nebre was our sales agent and he was great.	Be sure to ask what parts they will use for your repair; it's important to know if you're getting new, rebuilt or recycled pieces for your hard earned dollar.	Gebron did not have to sweeten the deal, because he's already offering a great service and a very reasonable price.	It's not like I'm some great customer; I probably go in about once a year so it wasn't like they recognized me as a valued regular and did me a favor based on that.	Zac was awesome!	I would definitely recommend this dealership especially if you are looking for a used BMW.	But we called up Enterprise and they arranged to have someone come patch it without giving us the slightest bit of grief over it.	He always treated me well when he managed Big O tires and now as manager of Eastside Motor Company, I have not only bought two vehicles from him, he has sold a truck for me as well.	To me, it just doesn't add up.	We were given one and an IOU for the second which we were told we would receive "in a few days" in the mail.	The only reason why I went elsewhere this time was because I was searching for a very specific make, model, year and mileage----something they simply did not have at Liberty Bay.	Overall it was a very pleasant, easy transaction.	They don't have any idea why I wasn't notified, apparently, and offered to FedEx them to me.	But with Jonathan, he was super easy going, genuine guy that doesn't get that stereotype "salesman" & was able to answer all my questions as much as possible.	BUT Jamie and Richard never wavered.	Probably the most pleasant car buying experience I've had in a long time.	I ended up waiting a while since I don't do a lot of city driving.	I have taken my little convertible bug here many times for many different issues.	Could it have been possible that he did not have good supporting staff to provide him the correct information?	My car knowledge is limited and my need for a new ride is non-existent, but some times it's fun to look at pretty things and pretend that I understand the "car guy" language.	I would provide him feedback on my thought of the cars.	I am never using hertz again.	The guy was very angry and irritated when we would ask certain questions about the issues.	The inside was pretty clean.	Excellent service and quality vehicles.	She told me a little about the process over the phone and shortly after, I drove my rental down to their lot.	Heidi is sweet and amazing.	I would definitely recommend coming here to find a car.	I am so grateful to have such a great place to take my SAAB!	Dominic made the process so easy on my part!	Great salesman, Phil, was the first guy undaunted by the fact that I was accompanied by 3-year-old twin girls.	Is it possible to give a NEGATIVE TEN stars?	Thank you so much for helping him!	I declined this terrible service and have no plans to visit them again.	I highly recommend buying a car from Enterprise Car Sales.	Very good experience, took care of detailing and preparing vehicle for resale.	I`m glad we found these guys.	10 weeks later I get my car back!	The clear coat on my car was peeling.	Otherwise, it would have been a lower score.	There are essentially a no-dicker sticker type of place with very fair pricing on their cars and not full of stereotypical high pressure used car salespeople.	I requested a few repairs based on a pre-purchase inspection.	I called 3 times on a Friday to ask about my loan application, of course John wasn't there, a random person I've never talked to called me back, said I'll call and find out give me An hour, what a surprise no call back, ever to this day a week ago.	Sammy is nice, but Ross & Jen (I think thats her name) are nasty people.	This review is for the sales department.	I would warn any potential customers to stay away from this establishment, and I would rather pay full cost at a regular auto shop than come here even for any under-warranty care.	They worked with me very well and gave me a higher trade in price than volkswagen of tacoma wanted to give me.	He is keeping our beloved VW Passat alive and rolling.	Subaru in general does not stand behind their product!	Joseph

Nate and Ian at Troll Motors take fantastic care of my car.	My car was very clean, as we're other cars in the lot.	Sold us a car with a recall but gave us no notice (illegal).	She mentioned that she works with a couple of local dealers and suggested that I go on some test drives with her contacts and to do my own research as well  (which would also give me some price comparisons).	She was by far one of the best sales people we have ever worked with.	I had a good experience with buying a car from james at halo,  there was no pressure, the car is nice, the deal was good, james was very responsive throughout the process and was always available for follow ups.	I test drove 3 minivans before deciding on the Town and Country and they gave me a fair trade in value on my old car.	Chris was helpful and informative.	Les Schwab had replaced a tire a few weeks prior and informed me that my shocks and struts were "beyond damaged" but I wanted a second opinion.	We highly recommend Paramount Motors NW and will certainly tell all our friends and co-workers about them.	He was very nice throughout the whole process and got me a deal I was happy with.	Awesome dealership.	***

I have never posted a review before but had such a good experience with purchasing a used car with this dealership that I wanted to.	Terrible experience with these guys!	John said they could probably help cover the labor on the brakes.	I couldn't bend rod back, but hood is flexible enough (yay Ford quality!)	Almost unheard of but quite suspicious.	I am pleased with the customer service here.	Highly recommend!	Contrary to the photos, this dealership has no or very little parking.	so stupid to buy a car after looking at it for an hour or two and I was filled with rage, remorse, regret...the worst of the worst.	After talking everything over and test driving the car, I drove away on my newly acquired, pristine M5 and I couldn't be any happier with the way I was treated.	It is a car dealership, you won't be wowed as they are a small business, but they try to make things work.	We didn't get a "steal," but we got a fair price and after-purchase support for any changes or upgrades we decide to get.	When we found the car had an airbag repair that was needed, Tony agreed to use the repair shop we wanted.....and took care of the repair.	Chris Kummar was the sales person.	Took the car for a lengthy test drive by my self.	I did have rusty rotors on both left and right, and it was machined, brakes replaced, no problem.	He made our daughter feel very comfortable considering she has never had to test drive or purchase a car on her own.	Great place to purchase vehicle.	This is something altogether different.	Such a great experience here!
